                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                </p> <p>

                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                  used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> 
                <h2><strong>Information Collection</strong></h2> <p>
                  For a better experience, while using our Service, I
                  may require you to provide us with certain personally
                  identifiable information such as:</p>

                <h2><strong>How I Collect Data</strong></h2>
                <p>The inforamtion above is colected in two ways:</p>

                  <li>The data is collected <strong>automatically</strong> - meaning, if you use my Service, I may collect data such as device resolution, type, and orientation.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><strong>How I Use Your Personal Information</strong></h2>
                <p>I do not use the photos you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the functionality that changes the device wallpaper and lock screen wallpaper.</p>

                <!----> <h2><strong>Log Data</strong></h2> <p>
                  I want to inform you that whenever you
                  use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
                  I collect data and information on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                  include information such as the time the error occured and error message.
                  <p>This Log Data always stays on the device and is only meant for development purposes.</p>
                </p> <h2><strong>Cookies</strong></h2> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory.
                </p> <p>
                  This Service does not use these “cookies” as it doesn't use any online service.
                </p> <h2><strong>How I Share The Information You Provide</strong></h2> <p>
                  The information you provide is not shared with any third party service as the app doesn't rely on any third party service and the provided data never leaves the device.
                </p> 
                <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it.
                  The app doesn't use any online service, and I guarantee its absolute security.
